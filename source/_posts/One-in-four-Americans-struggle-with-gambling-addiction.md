#  One in four Americans struggle with gambling addiction

Gambling addiction is one of the most pervasive and least understood addictions in the United States. A recent study by the University of Southern California Institute for Creative Technologies found that one in four Americans struggle with gambling addiction.

This number may be even higher, as many people with gambling addiction do not seek help. Gambling addiction is an impulse control disorder, which means that people with this disorder cannot resist urges or temptations to gamble.

Some people develop gambling addiction after winning money at a casino or taking home a large jackpot. Others become addicted to gambling after losing money in a series of bets.

Gambling addiction can have devastating consequences for individuals and families. People with gambling addiction often lose large sums of money, which can lead to financial ruin. They may also experience relationship problems and job loss due to their compulsive gambling.

There is no one-size-fits-all treatment for gambling addiction, but some common treatments include therapy and medication. Some people find support groups helpful, while others prefer individual therapy.

If you or someone you know struggles with gambling addiction, seek help! There is hope for recovery, and treatment can help you get your life back on track.

#  Half of all problem gamblers attempt suicide

Problem gambling is a serious issue that can have negative consequences on the gambler and their loved ones. New research has found that half of all problem gamblers attempt suicide.

The study, which was conducted by researchers at the University of Calgary, looked at the suicide rates of more than 1,600 problem gamblers. The researchers found that 49 percent of problem gamblers had attempted suicide at some point in their lives.

The study also found that problem gamblers were much more likely to attempt suicide than the general population. Suicide rates for men who were problem gamblers were found to be six times higher than the general population, and suicide rates for women who were problem gamblers were found to be 11 times higher than the general population.

According to lead researcher Dr. Jeffrey Derevensky, these findings highlight the seriousness of problem gambling and the need for better interventions and treatments for this condition.

“This study confirms how serious a public health issue gambling addiction is,” said Derevensky in a press release. “The numbers are frightening and underscore how important it is to get help for those affected by this disease as soon as possible.”

Problem gambling can have devastating consequences for both the gambler and their loved ones. The new study shows that suicide rates among problem gamblers are significantly higher than in the general population, highlighting the importance of seeking help if you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction.
