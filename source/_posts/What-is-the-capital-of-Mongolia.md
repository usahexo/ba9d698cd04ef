#  What is the capital of Mongolia?

The capital of Mongolia is Ulaanbaatar.

#  What is the population of Mongolia?

The population of Mongolia is 3.1 million, as of 2019. This is a slight increase from the previous estimate of 2.9 million in 2018. The population is rapidly growing, with an annual growth rate of 1.5%.

Mongolia is the most sparsely populated country in the world, with an average of just 2 people per square kilometer. However, almost half of the population lives in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar.

The majority of the population is Mongolian (85%), with the next largest group being Kazakh (5%). Over 10% of the population is Russian, and there are also small populations of Chinese and other ethnic groups.

#  What are some major cities in Mongolia?

Ulaanbaatar is by far the largest city in Mongolia, with a population of over 1.4 million. It is also one of the fastest-growing cities in the world, with a rate of growth of over 8% per year. Other major cities include Darkhan (population: over 100,000) and Erdenet (population: over 85,000).

Most settlements in Mongolia are relatively small, with less than 10,000 people. However, there are a few mid-sized cities such as Choibalsan (population: over 30,000) and Dalanzadgad (population: over 25,000).

#  What is the GDP per capita of Mongolia?

The GDP per capita of Mongolia is $5,500.

#  What is the life expectancy in Mongolia?

Mongolia is a country located in East Asia. It is bordered by China to the south and Russia to the north. The country has a population of around 3 million people and the capital city is Ulaanbaatar.

The life expectancy in Mongolia is currently estimated at around 70 years for men and 76 years for women. This is an improvement on the figures from just a few decades ago, when the life expectancy for both men and women was significantly lower. However, the country still lags behind some of its neighbours in terms of life expectancy.

There are a number of factors that contribute to the relatively low life expectancy in Mongolia. One of these is the high levels of poverty and social inequality in the country. There is also a lack of access to health care services, particularly in rural areas. In addition, rates of HIV/AIDS and other diseases are high in Mongolia.

Despite these challenges, there have been some improvements in recent years with regards to life expectancy in Mongolia. This can be attributed to a number of factors, including improved access to health care services, as well as rising levels of education and awareness about health and nutrition issues. In addition, economic development in recent years has helped to improve living standards and reduce poverty levels in Mongolia.

#  What are some of the major exports of Mongolia?

Mongolia is a landlocked country between Russia and China. It’s considered the least densely populated country in the world. Despite its size, Mongolia has a lot to offer in terms of exports.

# What are some of the major exports of Mongolia?

Some of the biggest exports from Mongolia include copper, cashmere, livestock, and wool. The country has been working to diversify its economy and attract more foreign investment in recent years, so that list may grow in the future.

# Copper is a valuable resource and accounts for a significant portion of Mongolian exports.

Copper is one of the most valuable resources in Mongolia. The metal is abundant in the country and easily mined. In fact, Mongolia is home to one-third of the world’s copper reserves. Much of that copper is exported every year, making it a key part of the Mongolian economy.

# Cashmere is another important export for Mongolia.

Cashmere has been an important part of the Mongolian economy for many years. The soft wool comes from goats that live in the cold steppes of central Asia. The cashmere industry employs thousands of people in Mongolia and brings in millions of dollars in revenue each year.

# Livestock is also a major export for Mongolia.

Livestock has long been an important part of the Mongolian economy. The country is home to vast herds of sheep, goats, and cattle. Meat and dairy products from those animals are exported all over the world, making livestock one of Mongolia’s biggest exports.
