#  Neymar Jr. Leads Santos To First-Ever Serie A Championship

Neymar Jr.’s hat-trick against Portuguesa sealed Santos’ first ever Serie A championship. The victory also marked Neymar Jr.’s third consecutive hat-trick, which is a new club record.

Santos had been struggling in the league for many years and it was starting to look like they would never win the title. However, with Neymar Jr. leading the way, things are starting to change.

The 20-year-old has been in scintillating form this season and shows no signs of slowing down. He has now scored an incredible 31 goals in just 27 league appearances.

With Neymar Jr. playing at this level, Santos are a force to be reckoned with and should be able to win more titles in the future.

#  Fluminense Falls Just Short Of The Title In Dramatic Fashion

After an intense season full of twists and turns, the last few rounds of Brazil’s Serie A had everything a football fan could hope for. The race for the title came down to the wire, with just a single point separating first-place Fluminense from their cross-town rivals Flamengo. In the end it was Flamengo who narrowly claimed the trophy, winning their final match while Fluminense lost theirs in dramatic fashion.

The scenes at the final whistle were gut-wrenching for Flu fans. Trailing 2-1 with only minutes remaining, they looked to have blown their chance at glory. But in a stunning turn of events, they managed to score twice in stoppage time to level the scores and send the game into extra time. Unfortunately they couldn’t hold on, conceding again in extra time and losing 3-2.

The defeat was heartbreaking but Fluminense can take some consolation in putting up a fight against one of Brazil’s strongest teams. This is a side that will no doubt be challenging for the title once again next season and there’s no doubt that they will be even stronger after gaining some much-needed experience this year.

#  Gremio Grapples Their Way To The Top 

In Brazil, there is one team that has stood the test of time and emerged as one of the top teams in the country. This team is Gremio, based out of Porto Alegre.

Gremio first came onto the scene in 1915, when they were founded as a club football team. They quickly made a name for themselves in the regional leagues, and in 1981 they won their first championship. They would continue to dominate Brazilian football, winning four more championships in the 1980s.

The 1990s were a bit tougher for Gremio, as they only managed to win one championship. However, the 2000s saw them return to glory, with three championships. And now, in the 2010s, they are still going strong. As of this writing, they are currently in first place in the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A (the top division of Brazilian football), and it looks like they may very well win their sixth championship this decade.

What is it that makes Gremio so successful? There are many factors at work here. First and foremost, Gremio have always had some of the best players in Brazil. This includes guys like Jardel, Bebeto, Ronaldo Nazario de Lima (better known as Ronaldo), and Luiz Adriano dos Santos (better known as Luiz Adriano). Additionally, Gremio have always been very well-coached. They have had some great coaches over the years, including Vanderlei Luxemburgo and Renato Portaluppi (more commonly known as Rênato Gaúcho).

Lastly, Gremio have always been a very well-rounded team. They are not just good at attacking; they are also good at defending. This has helped them to become champions even during tough times period where they were not scoring as many goals as they would have liked.

All of these factors have come together to make Gremio one of the most successful clubs in Brazilian football history. And there is no signs that they plan on slowing down anytime soon!

#  Corinthians Clinches Seventh Straight Title

The Corinthians have once again clinched their spot as the best Brazilian football team, securing their seventh consecutive title. This impressive achievement comes after a hard-fought season in which they narrowly defeated rivals Palmeiras with a final score of 2-1.

Led by coach Tite, who was brought on in 2016 and has overseen the team’s success ever since, Corinthians has become one of the most dominant clubs in Brazil – and indeed all of South America. In addition to their seven straight titles, they’ve also won three Copa do Brasil trophies and two Campeonato Paulista championships.

Interestingly, not all of Corinthians’ success can be attributed to their players alone. Tite has proven himself to be an excellent coach, able to motivate and inspire his team to achieve great things. And it seems that this year was no exception; despite a few shaky moments throughout the season, Corinthians pulled through in the end thanks to some excellent teamwork and discipline.

All in all, it’s been an incredible year for Corinthians – and there’s every reason to believe that they’ll continue their winning streak into the future. Here’s to hoping that they can bring home even more titles in the years to come!

#  Sao Paulo Struggles In their Quest For New Dominance

Sao Paulo have always been one of the most dominant forces in South American football, but in the last year or so they have struggled to find their feet. With the likes of Messi, Suarez and Neymar all departing for Europe, the Brazilian side has had to rebuild and find new stars to lead them to glory.

One player who has shone in this rebuilding phase is Richarlison. The young Brazilian winger was signed from Watford for a fee of around £40 million, and he has already shown his worth by scoring six goals in eight appearances for the club.

However, despite the promise of Richarlison and other young stars such as Casemiro andGabriel Jesus, Sao Paulo have struggled in recent months. They were knocked out of the Copa Libertadores earlier this year by Colombian side Independiente, and they are currently sixth in Brazil’s Serie A table.

There are a number of reasons for this underperformance. Firstly, the team has lost its spine with the departures of Neymar, Suarez and Messi. Secondly, many of their top players are now playing in Europe and are not available for selection on a regular basis. And thirdly, the club has been unable to replace these players with similar quality signings.

In order to return to the top of South American football, Sao Paulo will need to rebuild once again. This time they will need to find new stars not just from Brazil, but from all over South America. They will also need to find a way to keep their best players from leaving for Europe. And finally, they will need to make sure that any new signings are of high quality and can make an immediate impact on the team.
