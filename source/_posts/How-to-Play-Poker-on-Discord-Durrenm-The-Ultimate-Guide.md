#  How to Win at Poker on Discord Durrenm

This is an outline on how to win at poker on Discord.

## What you need to know Poker is all about making the best hand from the cards dealt to you. In order to do this, you need to know what the rank of each card is, and what type of card it is. The rank of a card is simply its value, with Aces being high and 2s being low. There are 4 suits in a deck of cards - clubs ( ), diamonds ( ), hearts ( ) and spades ( ). Each suit has 13 cards, with Ace counting as both 1 and 11, and 2-10 counting as their face value. There are also 2 wildcards in a deck - the joker, which can be used as any other card in the deck, and the deuce (2), which can be used as either a 2 or a 1.

In poker, there are 3 main types of hands - pairs, two-card hands and three-card hands. A pair is made up of two cards of the same rank, such as two kings. A two-card hand is made up of two cards of different ranks, such as an ace and a king. A three-card hand is made up of three cards of different ranks, such as three queens. In order to win a poker hand, your hand must have higher rank than your opponents'. If all players have the same rank card then the player with the highest value card wins - for example, if two players both have sixes as their highest rank card then the player with the 7 beats the player with the 6. If both players have pairs then the player with the highest pair wins. If both players have two-card hands then the player with the highest value card in their hand wins.

In order to calculate who has won a poker hand, first work out who has the best hand according to rank (Aces are high). If there is more than one player with the best hand then compare their second-highest rank card etc until there is one clear winner. For example:


1) Player 1: King Queen suited
2) Player 2: Jack 10 suited 
3) Player 3: Eight six offsuit

Player 1 would win because they have a King-Queen suited hand, which is higher ranked than either Player 2's Jack-10 suited or Player 3's Eight-six offsuit hands.

#  The Best Tips and Tricks for Playing Poker on Discord Durrenm

If you enjoy playing poker and want to do so with others online, Discord might be the perfect platform for you. Here are some tips and tricks to help you get started.

First, make sure you join or create a Poker channel. This will be the main hub for all things poker on Discord.

Next, try to find people to play with. There are a few different ways to do this. You can either post in the Poker channel looking for players, or look for specific game rooms that have been created by other players.

Once you've found some people to play with, it's time to start playing! The first thing you'll need to do is agree on a game format. There are a few different formats that are commonly used on Discord:

- Texas Hold'em - Omaha - 5 Card Draw - 7 Card Stud - Razz

Once the game format has been agreed upon, it's time to start dealing cards. In general, the dealer will deal one card at a time to each player face down, starting with the player on their left. The next card is turned over (the flop) and placed in the middle of the table. This is followed by another card given to each player (the turn), and finally a final card (the river). After the river has been dealt, players will then have a chance to complete their hands. The best hand wins the pot!

There are a few things you can do during gameplay to give yourself an edge:

- Pay attention to your opponents' betting patterns. This can give you clues about what type of hand they might have. - Use your position at the table to your advantage. Players who are sitting in later positions usually have more information than those who are sitting in early positions. - Be aware of the community cards and use them to construct possible hands.
