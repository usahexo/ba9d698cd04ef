#  NY Giants Fans Can Bet on Games Now!

The New York Giants are a professional American football team based in the New York metropolitan area. The Giants compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) East division. The team plays its home games at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, which it shares with the New York Jets in an arrangement known as "co-ownership".

The Giants were founded in 1925 and are the oldest franchise in the NFL. They have won eight NFL championships: four in the pre-Super Bowl era (1927, 1934, 1938, 1956) and four since the advent of the Super Bowl (XXI (1986), XXV (1990), XLII (2007), and XLVI (2011)), along with 22 NFC championships. The Giants have played in the Super Bowls XXI, XXVIII, XLII, XLVI, and XIV.

Until 2009, the Giants were owned by John Mara and his brother Timothy Mara. In February 2009, they were sold to John K. Mara and Steve Tisch.

The Giants began playing in 1925 as a founding member of the American Professional Football Association (APFA). That same year, the team was renamed the New York Giants. At various points over their history they have been known as The Big Blue Wrecking Crew,[8] The New York Football Giants,[9] and most recently as simply The Giants.[10]MetLife Stadium is one of two NFL stadiums shared by two clubs; MetLife Stadium is home to both the New York Giants of the National Football League and to Jeld-Wen Field's Portland Thorns FC of women's professional soccer league NWSL . From 1973 to 2009 Sun Devil Stadium was home to both original Arizona Cardinals CFL football club while they played outdoors then what is now Arizona State University Sun Devils while they moved indoors. 

NY GIANTS FANS CAN BET ON GAMES NOW! 
In February of 2019, it was announced that NY Giants fans could now bet on games through Caesars Entertainment properties. This makes NY one of just six states where fans can legally place bets on NFL games. There are a few different ways that fans can bet on their favorite teams, but most commonly people will bet on who will win or how many points will be scored in a game. Bets can also be made on which team will cover or exceed a point spread, as well as whether either side will score in overtime if one is required. 
Many experts are predicting that this move will increase viewership for NFL games across all markets as people will have a vested interest in more games. Not only does this make watching football more exciting for fans, but it also provides another stream of revenue for teams and leagues alike. Bettors are typically classified into three categories: squares , pros , and sharks . Squares are your average fan who bets randomly or with gut instinct while pros are those who closely follow teams’ stats and tendencies before making a decision . Sharks are bookmakers or professional bettors who make a living from betting sports . 
It should be noted that not everyone is happy about this change – some believe that it will lead to more corruption within professional sports. Only time will tell how things play out, but for now NY Giants fans can enjoy placing some friendly wagers on their favorite team!

#  NY Giants Win Supreme Court Battle OverSports Betting

The New York Giants won a Supreme Court battle Wednesday that could pave the way for legalized sports betting across the United States.

Justices overturned a 26-year-old federal law that barred most states from authorizing gambling on football, basketball, baseball and other sports.

Now it will be up to each state to decide whether to allow sports betting.

The Giants argued that the 1992 federal law, which was called the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, violated the 10th Amendment by intruding into states' rights.

Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the opinion that Congress "may not regulate sports gambling directly" but "may protect the integrity of sport."

"The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make," Alito said. "Congress can regulate sports gambling directly, but if it elects not to do so, each state is free to act on its own."

#  Giants Fans Rejoice as Sports Betting is Legalized in New York

On Monday, the governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, signed a bill that would legalize sports gambling in the state. This is great news for the many New York Giants fans who enjoy making a wager on their team’s games.

Prior to this bill being passed, sports betting was only legal in Nevada and Delaware. Now, with New York joining those states, there are three major markets where people can place bets on sporting events.

One of the main proponents of legalizing sports betting in New York was Chris Churchill, a columnist for the Albany Times Union. In an article he wrote last month, Churchill said that legalizing sports gambling would be good for the state economy. He estimated that it could generate up to $23 million in annual revenue, as well as create jobs.

Churchill may be right about the economic benefits of legalizing sports gambling, but there are also other reasons why it makes sense for New York. One is that it would allow the state to regulate and tax the industry, which would generate additional revenue. Another is that it would help to combat illegal gambling operations, which are currently thriving without any regulation or oversight.

Opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it could lead to addiction and other social problems. However, these concerns can be addressed by implementing strong regulations governing how sports betting can be conducted.

In any case, Giants fans should be happy that they will soon have another way to cheer on their favorite team – by placing a wager on its games!

#  NY Supreme Court Rules in Favor of Giants Fans Being Able to Bet on Games

The New York Supreme Court ruled in favor of Giants fans being allowed to bet on the team's games, overturning a state law that prohibited it. The case was brought to court by a group of Giants fans who argued that the prohibition on betting violated their free speech rights.

"We are pleased with the court's decision, which confirms what we have said all along - that the law prohibiting betting on NFL games is unconstitutional," said Abraham Hirsch, lead counsel for the plaintiffs. "This is a victory for Giants fans and all sports fans in New York."

According to Hirsch, the state law prohibits not just gambling on NFL games, but also discussing or disseminating information about betting on those games. This makes it difficult for fans to engage in casual conversation about the team or express their opinions about the game without fear of being prosecuted.

"The First Amendment protects our right to express our opinions about the teams we root for, and to have a conversation about betting on those games," said Hirsch. "We are glad that the court recognizes that and has struck down this unconstitutional law."

The state Attorney General's Office had argued that the law was necessary to protect the integrity of NFL games. However, the court rejected this argument, stating that there was no evidence that banning gambling on NFL games actually protected their integrity.
