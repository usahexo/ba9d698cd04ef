#  Loft racing not really illegal gambling dispute continues in court

Organized and professional loft racing for sport birds, especially pigeons, is nothing new. The birds have been raced in this way for centuries and the practice has evolved over time. What many people do not know is that this type of racing can be classified as illegal gambling in some jurisdictions. In spite of this fact, loft races continue to take place around the world and often generate a great deal of interest among participants and spectators alike.

There are a number of different ways in which loft racing can be considered illegal gambling. One such way is if there is money or any other valuable thing at stake in the race. Another way is if the race organizers or participants are engaging in it for profit rather than for sport or recreation. Finally, if the race is being held in an area where it is prohibited by law, then it can also be classified as illegal gambling.

It should be noted that simply engaging in a loft race does not automatically make one guilty of illegal gambling. It is only when certain elements such as money or other valuable items are at stake, or when the race is being conducted for profit, that criminal charges may be brought against those involved. In many cases, authorities will simply issue a warning to those involved and no further action will be taken.

Despite the fact that loft racing can be considered illegal gambling in some areas, there does not seem to be any shortage of participants or interest in these types of races. This may be due, in part, to the fact that there is often a considerable amount of prize money up for grabs. In addition, there is a great deal of excitement and anticipation among competitors and spectators leading up to the big day when the results are announced.

#  precisely how is one loft racing not really gambling? Player claims he's just a hobbyist

The statement looks dubious. If the video game is really just like betting on actual horse races, then why is it not gambling? The answer may seem to be found in the difference between fixed and arbitrary games - loft racing is much more arbitrary. In bet on races, there are physical factors that can determine the victor, like stamina and speed. With loft racing, these external aspects do not exist; players depend much more on their own judgement calls as to which bird will fly higher or faster. This leaves a lot of space for chance in what's effectively a race determined by bird height.
