#  Iowa Gambling Crackdown Nets 22 Slot Machine Operators 

On Tuesday, July 17, Iowa gambling regulators announced that they had penalized 22 slot machine operators across the state as part of a crackdown on illegal gambling.

The Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission (IRGC) said that the 22 operators were fined a combined total of $105,000. The IRGC also seized 167 machines from the operators.

This latest crackdown on illegal gambling in Iowa is part of an ongoing effort by the IRGC to combat illegal gaming in the state. In June, the IRGC announced that it had penalized 21 other slot machine operators, seizing 192 machines in the process.

"This is an ongoing effort by the commission to crack down on these illegal operations," said Brian Ohorilko, executive director of the IRGC. "We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to identify and take action against these illegal operations."

While casino gambling is legal in Iowa, there are a number of smaller casinos and slot machine parlors throughout the state that operate illegally. The IRGC has been cracking down on these operations in recent years, issuing fines and seizures as part of its effort to enforce Iowa's gambling laws.

#  Calif. Indian Tribe Loses Federal Suit to Legally operate Slot Machines 

The convergence of tribal and commercial gambling interests in many parts of the United States has led to litigation over the years as tribes attempt to gain parity with state-sanctioned gambling. This week, a California tribe lost a federal lawsuit in which it sought the right to operate slot machines on its reservation.

The Pechanga Band of Luiseno Indians has been attempting to overturn a 2009 determination by the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) that it could not offer Class III gaming, which includes slots and blackjack, on its reservation. The tribe asserted that the commission’s decision was based on a technicality and that it should be allowed to offer the same type of gaming as other California tribes.

A federal district court judge ruled against the tribe, however, finding that it had not exhausted all of its administrative remedies before filing suit. The court also noted that the tribe’s claim was without merit because it had not shown that it met all of the requirements for offering Class III gaming under federal law.

This ruling is just the latest in a series of legal setbacks for tribes seeking to expand their gambling operations. In 2011, a federal appeals court ruled against the Mohegan Tribe in Connecticut, which had sought to open a casino on land it owned outside its reservation. That case is now pending before the U.S. Supreme Court.

#  Is Online Gambling Illegal in the United States? 

There is no definitive answer to this question as the legality of online gambling in the United States can vary from state to state. Generally, however, most forms of online gambling are illegal in the US.

This is because, in 2006, then-President George W. Bush signed the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) into law. This Act prohibits financial institutions from processing transactions related to online gambling.

While there have been attempts to repeal or amend the UIGEA, it has thus far remained in effect. As such, most forms of online gambling are illegal in the US.

That said, there are some exceptions. For example, certain states have passed laws legalizing and regulating certain forms of online gambling. And there are also some offshore websites that allow Americans to gamble online legally.

So, while online gambling is generally illegal in the US, there are some exceptions. It is important to check your state's laws before engaging in any form of online gambling.

#  Maryland Slot Machine Operator Fined $10,000

The Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Agency announced last week that it has fined a slot machine operator in the state $10,000 for violating gaming regulations.

According to the agency, the operator was found to have been allowing individuals who were not authorized to play the machines to do so. In addition, the agency reports that the operator was also permitting people under the age of 21 to gamble.

"This fines sends a message that we take our regulations seriously and will take enforcement actions when violations occur," said Gordon Medenica, Director of the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Agency.

The $10,000 fine is the largest that has been handed out by the agency since it began regulating slots in 2014.
