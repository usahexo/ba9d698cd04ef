Brazilian football was considered the best in the world a few years ago. The league has some of the best players and most passionate fans in the world. 

However, the quality of football on display has diminished in recent years. This is especially true when you consider how dominant Spanish and German teams have been in Europe.

One of the contributing factors to this decline is the number of slot machine games that have infiltrated Brazilian football stadiums. Brasileiro Serie A teams are sponsored by gambling companies, which means there are an abundance of slot machines around stadiums.

Fans have complained about this issue for a while now, and it looks like something might finally be done about it. The Minister of Sport in Brazil, Leonardo Picciani, announced that he would work to remove all slot machine games from football stadiums across the country.

This is great news for Brazilian football fans and should help improve the quality of football on display in Brasileiro Serie A. Hopefully, other South American countries will follow Brazil’s lead and remove slot machine games from their stadiums as well.
