#  Atlanta Falcons Hope to Put Off Season Ending Split

For the last few seasons, the Atlanta Falcons have been one of the most consistent teams in the NFL. Led by quarterback Matt Ryan and wide receiver Julio Jones, the Falcons have made it to the playoffs each year. However, they have failed to make it past the Divisional Round. This season, they are in danger of splitting up.

The Falcons started off strong, winning their first four games. However, they have lost their last three games, putting them in danger of missing the playoffs altogether. If they lose their next two games, they will be eliminated from playoff contention.

The offense has been struggling lately, scoring just 16 points per game over their last three contests. This is a far cry from the 33 points per game they averaged in the first four games of the season. The biggest reason for the decline has been Julio Jones’s lack of production. He has just 186 receiving yards and zero touchdowns over his last three games.

If Atlanta wants to salvage their season, they will need to get Jones back on track. He is too important to the team for them to falter down the stretch. If he can return to form, the Falcons should be able to make it to the playoffs once again.

#  Atlanta Falcons Prepare for Tough Battle Ahead After Split

The Atlanta Falcons are coming off a difficult two-game stretch. They lost to the Philadelphia Eagles 18-12 in Week 1, then rebounded with a 38-17 victory over the Carolina Panthers in Week 2.

Despite the split, the Falcons remain confident heading into their matchup against the New Orleans Saints this Thursday. Falcons head coach Dan Quinn believes that his team is capable of winning any game they play this season.

“We have a lot of firepower on both sides of the ball, and our guys are battle-tested,” Quinn said. “We’re looking forward to getting back on the field and proving ourselves against New Orleans.”

Quinn is especially confident in his defense, which has been one of the best in the NFL this season. The Falcons held both Carson Wentz and Cam Newton under 300 yards passing,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) and they have yet to allow a touchdown through the air.

Offensively, Atlanta will look to get Julio Jones more involved in the game plan. Jones had just two catches for 24 yards against Philadelphia, but he bounced back with nine catches for 173 yards against Carolina.

The Saints present a tougher challenge than either the Eagles or Panthers. Led by quarterback Drew Brees, New Orleans is averaging nearly 400 yards of total offense per game. However, they also have a weak defense that has allowed 30 points or more in three of their four games this season.

If Atlanta can take advantage of New Orleans’s poor defense and limit turnovers, they should be able to come away with a victory on Thursday night.

#  Atlanta Falcons Hope to Regroup After Devastating Split

Just two weeks ago, the Atlanta Falcons were one of the hottest teams in the NFL. They had won five games in a row and appeared to be on their way to a playoff berth. However, after a devastating split with the New Orleans Saints, things have taken a turn for the worse.

The Falcons’ offense was unable to get anything going against the Saints’ defense. In fact, they were only able to muster up six points in the entire game. This is a far cry from their usual output, which has averaged over 25 points per game this season.

Meanwhile, the Saints’ offense was able to put up 31 points against the Falcons’ defense. This included three touchdown passes from Drew Brees. This was helped by the fact that Alvin Kamara was able to rush for 116 yards and add another 58 receiving yards.

The loss dropped the Falcons to sixth place in the NFC playoff race. They now find themselves behind not only the Saints, but also the Carolina Panthers and Seattle Seahawks. All of these teams have better conference records than Atlanta does.

This means that the Falcons will need to win out in order to make it to the playoffs. This includes wins over both the Buccaneers and Panthers in their final two games. While this is possible, it is not likely given how they have played lately.

If they falter down the stretch, it is likely that offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian will take much of the blame. He has come under fire recently for his play-calling decisions, which have been questioned by many analysts.

Regardless of what happens in their final two games, it looks like 2017 will not be kind to Atlanta Falcons fans.

#  Atlanta Falcons Look to Future After Devastating Season Ending Split

The 2017-2018 Atlanta Falcons season was one for the ages. The Falcons started out 5-0 and were looking like Super Bowl contenders. However, after a devastating Week 10 loss to the New Orleans Saints, the Falcons would go on to lose six of their last seven games, including a first-round playoff exit to the Philadelphia Eagles. This article will take a look at what went wrong for the Falcons in the second half of the season and how they can improve for next year.

Atlanta’s offense regressed dramatically in the second half of the season. In their first nine games, they averaged 395 yards per game; in their last seven games, they averaged only 308 yards per game. Much of this drop-off can be attributed to quarterback Matt Ryan’s poor play. After throwing 14 touchdowns and only two interceptions in the first nine games, Ryan threw only six touchdowns and seven interceptions in the last seven games. Additionally, running back Devonta Freeman’s production declined significantly in the second half of the season. After averaging 95 rushing yards per game in the first nine games, Freeman averaged only 59 rushing yards per game in the last seven games.

The Falcons defense also struggled down the stretch. They allowed an average of 352 yards per game in their final seven games after allowing only 307 yards per game in their first nine games. Additionally, they allowed an average of 25 points per game in their final seven games after allowing an average of 18 points per game in their first nine games. This drop-off was largely due to injuries on defense. Starting cornerback Desmond Trufant missed four games late in the season with a concussion, and defensive end Adrian Clayborn missed two games with an injury.

Despite their struggles late in the season, there are still many reasons for optimism for Atlanta heading into next year. First and foremost is that Matt Ryan is still one of the best quarterbacks in the league and should rebound next year. Additionally, Devonta Freeman is one of the best running backs in the NFL and should have another good year. The Falcons also have one of the best wide receivers duos in Julio Jones and Mohamed Sanu, and they added Calvin Ridley through this year’s draft. Finally, they have one of the best coaches in Dan Quinn leading them.

While there are certainly some concerns for Atlanta heading into next year, they remain one of the best teams in football and should be a Super Bowl contender once again
