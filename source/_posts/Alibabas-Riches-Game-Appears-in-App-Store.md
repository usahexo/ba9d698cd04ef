#  Alibabas Riches Game Appears in App Store

A recent app released on the App Store has some people wondering if Alibaba is up to something. The app, named "Riches Game", is an idle game that has users accumulate wealth and compete with others on a leaderboard.

Alibaba has not commented on the app yet, but there are some obvious similarities between it and the recently shut down game "China's Got Talent". That game was also an idle game with a focus on wealth accumulation.

There are some major differences between the two games, though. For one, Riches Game is much more simplistic than China's Got Talent. Additionally, there is no indication that Alibaba will be adding any real-world rewards to Riches Game like they did with China's Got Talent.

So far, the app has only been downloaded a few thousand times, but it will be interesting to see if it gains any traction in the coming weeks. With Alibaba's backing, it's definitely possible that Riches Game could become a hit among Chinese gamers.

#  Alibabas Riches Game Targets Chinese Gamblers

When you think about online gambling, the first company that likely comes to mind is Casino.com. Owned by the British casino giant GVC Holdings, the site has been one of the most popular destinations for gamblers around the world for more than a decade. But as China's online gaming market continues to grow, a new king may be emerging in the form of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.'s newly launched gaming platform Tmall Game Carnival.

The new platform, which was soft-launched in January and went fully live at the beginning of February, offers a range of games including poker, mahjong and slots. And while it's still too early to tell how Tmall Game Carnival will compare to Casino.com, there are a number of factors working in its favor.

For starters, Alibaba is China's largest e-commerce company and has a wealth of resources that it can deploy to promote Tmall Game Carnival. The company has already been using its massive digital ecosystem to market the new platform, including WeChat—China's leading messaging app with over 1 billion users—as well as its suite of other apps such as Taobao and Alipay.

Second, there is currently no dominant player in China's online gambling market. While Casino.com has a strong presence in other countries, it has yet to make much of an impact in China. This provides an opportunity for Alibaba to capture market share from its rivals.

Finally, Chinese gamers are already very familiar with Alibaba's brands and products. This means that they are more likely to try out Tmall Game Carnival than players who are not familiar with Alibaba.

All told, Alibaba appears to be making a serious play for the Chinese online gambling market. If it can successfully capitalize on the factors mentioned above, it could soon become one of the world's largest operators of online gambling platforms.
